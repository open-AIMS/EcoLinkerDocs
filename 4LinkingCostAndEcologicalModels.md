# 4.	Linking cost and ecological models
Linking the cost models with the ecological models to assess intervention scenarios requires additional code (cost model sampling and sensitivity analysis code available at [cost_model_queries link](https://github.com/open-AIMS/cost_model_queries)

This requires the following:

-	Scenario settings adjusted, simplified, harmonised, standardised, and automated across cost and ecological models (see list of model parameters and interventions settings).
-	Sensitivity analysis of cost model parameters to develop space for Monte Carlo sampling of cost model data.
-	Expanding reef selection to all 3806 reefs as currently the cost models only capture 4 reefs. This would require pairing of available ports with all reefs and capturing reef combinations and capacity.
  
The key model parameters and scenario settings are summarised in Table 1. For the full list see Appendix. 

*Table 1: Summary of key model parameters and scenario settings*

| Parameter| Model    | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
|Deployment size/ number of devices | Aquaculture deployment and production, Larval Methods | The number of devices being produced and deployed.|
| 1YOEC yield | Aquaculture deployment and production, Larval Methods| The number of one year old corals resulting from a number of devices being deployed, accounting for mortality and loss prior to settlement at 1YO.|
| Reef | Aquaculture deployment | Reef to be deployed to (currently only 4 available in the model). | 
| Ship | Aquaculture deployment (soon Larval Methods but not currently) | Ship to be used (determines pricing for travel out to reef). |
| Deployment duration | Aquaculture deployment | Time taken between production and putting devices out the reef (generally set as 28 days). |
| Spawning count | Aquaculture production | Number of spawnings in a year. Can reduce costs for same number of devices. |
| Species | Aquaculture production | Species need separate tanks, so this could be the number of species which need different tank conditions, such as due to being from different regions. |
| Larval release pools | Larval Methods | Number of pools used to release coral larvae for settlement if using capture methods. Pools are assumed to have a particular coverage per hectare but this is uncertain. |
| Pre-spawning vessel | Larval Methods | Ship to use prior to spawning. |
| Spawning mothership | Larval Methods | Ship to use during spawning. |
| Spawning support ship | Larval Methods | Ship to support smaller trips to and from mothership during spawning (all ships add to costs). |
| Species batches | Aquaculture deployment and production, Larval Methods | A species in a particular region, these need different tanks for production/capture|
| New Species batches | Aquaculture deployment and production | New species need trips to the reef to study heat tolerance, incuring additonal costs.|
