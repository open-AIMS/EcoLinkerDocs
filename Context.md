# 1.	Context

The Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP) employs four ecological models to predict the outcome of alternative interventions (e.g., aquaculture, larval slicks):

-	ReefMod 
-	ADRIA 
-	C~scape 
-	CoCoNet
  
The corresponding models that capture the costs of these interventions have been developed by the T2D team.
In order to enable an economic assessment of intervention outcomes (i.e. cost-effectiveness analysis), the ecological benefit data estimated by means of the ecological models must be compatible with the cost data estimated by the cost models. The estimation of data capturing intervention cost and ecological benefits requires a harmonisation of model parameters and intervention settings across ecological and cost models. Such a harmonisation supports model integration and establishes a process of continuous harmonisation in the context of evolving models. 
The harmonisation effort is based on consultations and inputs of representatives of all four ecological models and the cost models. Their inputs have been been crucial to better understand of how to translate parameters between the models to assure consistent intervention scenario definitions and the underpinning model parameters.
The results of this harmonisation effort are provided in this documentation, which contributes to the larger effort within the study ‘Updating Intervention-Related Parameters Across MDS Models FY25’ (MDS-2024-003). The documentation includes a compilation of all the information gathered on each model relevant for model integration and a list of all parameters and settings that must be harmonised in any intervention scenario. It is considered a live document given the evolving nature of all models and needs to be updated on a regular basis.
